    <h2>
      THE FIRST ACT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>The scene represents a room high up in a Bloomsbury lodging-house. It
      is poorly, but not sordidly, furnished; and here and there are touches of
      taste, and some attempt at comfort. Nelly Morris, a young girl, dressed in
      a very old frock, the shabbiness of which she has attempted to hide by
      various feminine devices, is discovered sitting L. of table. A pile of
      medical books, topped by a skull, faces her. She is sitting with her
      elbows on table, her head in her hands, looking up at, and talking to, the
      skull.</i>
    </p>
    <h5>
      NELLY MORRIS.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Did you ever know what it was to be poor-real poor I mean? Do you know
      what Ted and I have got for dinner? Three sausages between us! That's one
      and a half&mdash;no, two for him because he's working, and one for me. And
      do you know what I am longing for more than anything else in the world? A
      great plate of roast beef&mdash;heaps of beef&mdash;and Yorkshire pudding
      and potatoes&mdash;large potatoes. (<i>Sniffs in the air.</i>) Did you
      ever feel like that? Did <i>you</i> ever try studying for an exam, on
      bread-and-butter for breakfast, bread-and-butter for dinner (when it won't
      run to the sausages), and bread, without butter, for supper, like poor Ted
      has to? Do you think he'll be able to learn enough on it to pass? Do you?
      (<i>Breaking down.</i>) Ah! you only grin at it all. 'Tis funny, isn't it?
      (<i>Laughing hysterically.</i>) I suppose we shall grin at it all when we
      are as old as you.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>The door at back opens, and Mrs. Wheedles, an old lady of the Mrs.
      Gummidge type, enters. Nelly hastily wipes away her tears.</i>)
    </p>
    <h5>
      MRS. WHEEDLES.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Oh! my dear, you gave me quite a turn. I made sure you'd got someone here.
    </p>
    <h5>
      NELLY MORRIS.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Only old Tapley, Mrs. Wheedles. I talk to him about my worries and he
      teaches me to laugh at them. Do you see how he's smiling? (<i>Takes skull
      and shows its face to Mrs Wheedles.</i>)
    </p>
    <h5>
      MRS. WHEEDLES.
    </h5>
    <p>
      (<i>Pushing it away.</i>) Oh, my dear, don't. You make me feel quite
      creepy. I do wish your brother wouldn't leave his bones about as he does.
      It's really hardly decent.
    </p>
    <h5>
      NELLY MORRIS.
    </h5>
    <p>
      We'll put something over him. (<i>Takes the skull to mantelpiece and ties
      pocket-handkerchief round it.</i>) You are shocking the susceptibilities
      of the British Matron, Mr. Tapley. You must be dressed.
    </p>
    <h5>
      MRS. WHEEDLES.
    </h5>
    <p>
      He doesn't look very well to-day, does he?
    </p>
    <h5>
      NELLY MORRIS.
    </h5>
    <p>
      What, Mr. Tapley? Oh, much the same as&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <h5>
      MRS. WHEEDLES.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Lor', no, my dear! how your mind does run on that nasty things I was
      speaking of your brother.
    </p>
    <h5>
      NELLY MORRIS.
    </h5>
    <p>
      You don't think he's going to break down?
    </p>
    <h5>
      MRS. WHEEDLES.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Oh no, my dear&mdash;at least we'll hope for the best. He seemed a bit
      pale, that's all.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Nelly takes books from the table and puts them away in case, and in
      other ways tidies up the room while talking.</i>)
    </p>
    <h5>
      NELLY MORRIS.
    </h5>
    <p>
      He's working so hard you see&mdash;so terribly hard. He'll be able to rest
      a bit when he's passed his exam.
    </p>
    <h5>
      MRS. WHEEDLES.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Yes, of course&mdash;that is if he does pass it.
    </p>
    <h5>
      NELLY MORRIS.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Don't say "if," Mrs. Wheedles, please. You don't know what it means to us.
      He must pass&mdash;he must. He's worked so hard.
    </p>
    <h5>
      MRS. WHEEDLES.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Ah, it's never those who know the most that do pass. I've had a few
      medicos, as they call themselves, through my hands, and it's always the
      ones that will never know the difference between croup and rheumatism that
      get through.
    </p>
    <h5>
      NELLY MORRIS.
    </h5>
    <p>
      I'm afraid that doesn't promise very well for Ted.
    </p>
    <h5>
      MRS. WHEEDLES.
    </h5>
    <p>
      No, my dear, I am sorely afraid he won't pass&mdash;sorely afraid. But
      there, you can never tell, and one should always look on the bright side
      of things, they say. (<i>Beginning to cry.</i>)
    </p>
    <h5>
      NELLY MORRIS.
    </h5>
    <p>
      You don't help one to do so very much, Mrs. Wheedles.
    </p>
    <h5>
      MRS. WHEEDLES.
    </h5>
    <p>
      I never like to see anyone too sanguine, my dear. He doesn't eat enough to
      keep himself well, and you won't let me send a little bit of anything up
      now and then.
    </p>
    <h5>
      NELLY MORRIS.
    </h5>
    <p>
      How can we, you kind old soul, when we owe you as much as we do already?
      And Heaven knows how we shall ever be able to pay you if he doesn't pass.
    </p>
    <h5>
      MRS. WHEEDLES.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Ah, you don't like to feel that you owe anything to a poor old
      lodging-house keeper. I only wish all of them were as considerate. I'd be
      better off than I am. But suppose, now, it didn't come out of my pocket,
      but from someone who could well afford it&mdash;who&mdash;was rich&mdash;and
      who&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <h5>
      NELLY MORRIS.
    </h5>
    <p>
      What do you mean, Mrs. Wheedles? Have you been telling anyone of our
      poverty? Have you been asking for charity for us?
    </p>
    <h5>
      MRS. WHEEDLES.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Lord help the child, no! How you do flare up. I haven't said a word to
      anyone. (<i>Aside.</i>) That's the truth anyhow.
    </p>
    <h5>
      NELLY MORRIS.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Please forgive me. I didn't mean to be cross. I know how kindly you meant
      it, but you don't understand. We're not so very poor, you know. Ted can't
      work if he eats heavily, and&mdash;&mdash;(<i>Turns away, choking a sob.</i>)
    </p>
    <h5>
      MRS. WHEEDLES.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Ah, poor dears&mdash;and both as proud as lucifers, so that nobody can
      help 'em. Ah, well, my dear, I only just looked in to cheer you up a bit.
      There's nothing I can do for you, I suppose?
    </p>
    <h5>
      NELLY MORRIS.
    </h5>
    <p>
      No, thank you, Mrs. Wheedles. I'll get you to let Martha boil me a few
      potatoes later on.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Knock heard at door, which Mrs. Wheedles has left open.</i>)
    </p>
    <h5>
      ADAM CHERRY.
    </h5>
    <p>
      (<i>Looking in</i>.) Can I come in?
    </p>
    <h5>
      MRS. WHEEDLES.
    </h5>
    <p>
      It's Mr. Cherry, my dear.
    </p>
    <h5>
      NELLY MORRIS.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Oh yes, come in, Mr. Cherry.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<i>Enter Cherry. He is a dapper little man of about fifty-five, but
      dresses, and tries to look younger. He carries a book in his hand which he
      seems anxious to keep out of sight.</i>)
    </p>
    <h5>
      ADAM CHERRY.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Ah, Mrs. Wheedles, you here?
    </p>
    <h5>
      ADAM CHERRY.
    </h5>
    <p>
      (<i>He looks from one to the other.</i>) I suppose you've been cheering up
      Miss Morris?
    </p>
    <h5>
      MRS. WHEEDLES.
    </h5>
    <p>
      (<i>Crying.</i>) Yes, Mr. Cherry. I just looked in to comfort her a bit,
      you know. I'm sure the poor child needs it.
    </p>
    <h5>
      ADAM CHERRY.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Ah, I'll tell you what it is, Mrs. Wheedles. Wheedles must have had a damp
      time of it. I don't wonder at his leaving you.
    </p>
    <h5>
      NELLY MORRIS.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Oh, do you think it wise to start her on Wheedles?
    </p>
    <h5>
      MRS. WHEEDLES.
    </h5>
    <p>
      I don't expect anyone to, Mr. Cherry, I'm sure. He was a fine-looking man,
      and there were those that lured him away. Not that I think it right that a
      man who's once promised to&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <h5>
      ADAM CHERRY.
    </h5>
    <p>
      No, no! of course not! I didn't mean that. He was a villain, Mrs. Wheedles&mdash;a
      villain. (<i>He bustles her, still crying, towards the door.</i>)
    </p>
    <h5>
      MRS. WHEEDLES.
    </h5>
    <p>
      No, I won't say that.
    </p>
    <h5>
      ADAM CHERRY.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Oh, I would, Mrs. Wheedles, if I were you. Only I'd go downstairs where I
      could have a good cry about it all to myself, and not come up again till I
      felt better.
    </p>
    <h5>
      MRS. WHEEDLES.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Ah, no, Mr. Cherry, crying won't mend matters. We must grin and bear
      things in this world. (<i>She is still crying.</i>) You bring down those
      potatoes whenever you're ready, dear. (<i>She goes off crying.</i>)
    </p>
    <h5>
      NELLY MORRIS.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Thank you, Mrs. Wheedles.
    </p>
    <h5>
      ADAM CHERRY.
    </h5>
    <p>
      (<i>He closes the door and returns to Nelly.</i>) That woman never wants
      to go to the seaside, you know. She has a salt-water bath every day.
    </p>
    <h5>
      NELLY MORRIS.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Poor old soul. I think she gets all her enjoyment out of being miserable.
    </p>
    <h5>
      ADAM CHERRY.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Yes, and you can't say she's selfish with it either. Oh, I just came up to
      bring you this (<i>showing book in his hand</i>)&mdash;"Gray's Anatomy." I
      came across it in turning over some old books of mine. It's&mdash;it's the
      book your brother was saying he wanted, isn't it?
    </p>
    <h5>
      NELLY MORRIS.
    </h5>
    <p>
      (Smiling as she looks at the palpably new volume.) You keep your "old
      books" nice and clean, Mr. Cherry.
    </p>
    <h5>
      ADAM CHERRY.
    </h5>
    <p>
      (<i>A little confused.</i>) Yes. I&mdash;I'm very careful of my books.

      (<i>Opening and reading title-page.</i>) Tenth edition, London, 1893. (<i>She

      takes it in both his and pats it gently.</i>)

    <h5>

    </h5>
    <p>
      How is Ted?
    </p>
    <h5>
      NELLY MORRIS.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Very overworked, Mr. Cherry.
    </p>
    <h5>
      ADAM CHERRY.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Ah, well, the examination is only six weeks off now, and then he must have
      a long rest.
    </p>
    <h5>
      NELLY MORRIS.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Yes, if he passes; if he doesn't, it means the old struggle all over
      again, only with less heart and (<i>Aside</i>) less bread-and-butter.
    </p>
    <h5>
      ADAM CHERRY.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Ah, now, that old woman has been doing that. You mustn't <i>think</i>
      about his not passing. He's <i>bound</i> to pass. I do wish she'd keep
      downstairs.
    </p>
    <h5>
      NELLY MORRIS.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Oh, it's better to be ready to face a thing, I suppose, than to be crushed
      by it when it does come. There are plenty do fail, and they are not always
      those that deserve to. And you see he's not strong and well just now, and
      it is such a hard fight. (<i>Vehemently</i>) Oh, if I could only do
      something to help him instead of being a drag upon him. It is so hard.
      Other girls can earn money&mdash;I haven't been brought up to do anything.
      There's nothing I can do&mdash;nothing, nothing.
    </p>
    <h5>
      ADAM CHERRY.
    </h5>
    <p>
      (<i>Earnestly</i>.) Nothing! (<i>Nelly, startled by his earnest tone,
      turns and looks at him.</i>) Suppose, my dear, there&mdash;there was
      something you could do&mdash;which would enable somebody else to help him&mdash;something
      which mightn't even be very unpleasant for you, either, and that only
      wanted a kind, loving, little heart. Suppose, my dear, some old fellow&mdash;not
      very old, you know, but just old enough to&mdash;to know your value, my
      dear&mdash;should say to you: I love you very, very dearly, my dear&mdash;and
      it would make me very, very happy to make you happy. Will you try to love
      me, my dear? Will you give me the right to&mdash;to take away all this
      trouble from you&mdash;to&mdash;to help you both. (<i>Nelly slowly crosses
      to fire, and stands looking into it.</i>) Don't you see, my dear I should
      be one of the family, and he couldn't mind my helping him then. You see&mdash;I&mdash;I've
      been working all my life, and making money, and now I've no one that I
      care for to spend it on. It would be so pleasant for me to&mdash;to feel
      that I was helping some brave, clever young fellow to get on in the world.
      It would make me so proud and happy to be helping those you cared for&mdash;to
      be taking care of you.

      It's no chaffing matter, Jack. It's a serious responsibility upon a fellow

      into the world, dies, poor lady. My father, feeling the sole
      responsibility of bringing up so extraordinary an infant as myself too
      much for him, marries a charming lady of whom I have always very much
      approved, a Miss Belinda Greggs, better known as Mdlle. Silvia, the
      beauteous and world-renowned skipping-rope artiste. This lady, upon the
      death of my father, marries your uncle. Thus Art becomes the golden link

    <h5>

    <p>
      Never. Experience is the cypher that explains the universe. I've been
      everything, done everything, made a note of everything, and understand
      everything. I've fought in Russia and made love in Spain, edited a
      newspaper in Calcutta, and ran a company in New York. Been imprisoned in
      Japan, and married in Egypt. I've studied mankind from the Equator to the
      Pole and I flatter myself I know the poor thing inside and out.

    </h5>
    <p>
      My dear fellow, I never was young. Age is a question of senses, not of
      seasons. I was born pretty much as you see me now. I told my first lie
      before most children can lisp the truth. I posed before most children can
      stand. I drank brandy at an age when most children lick sherbet, and made
      love while my co-temporaries were making mudpies.

      themselves exactly as I think of myself; I am setting them an example of

    <p>
      No, but they make a good foundation. Lord, I shall never forget the first
      night of that burlesque when you played Apollo to my Terps. You wore three
      pairs of tights, one over the other, and the underneath ones worked up
      into rucks. (<i>Cherry laughs uncomfortably.</i>) And the gallery told you
      to go home and get yourself ironed. (<i>Laughs.</i>)

    <h5>

    </h5>
    <p>
      Ah, yes; bad news travels fast, they say.
    </p>
    <h5>
      ADAM CHERRY.
    </h5>
    <p>
      (<i>Looking over at Ben Dixon.</i>) But, you know, somehow or other, I
      pictured such a different sort of man.
    </p>
    <h5>
      MRS. BEN DIXON.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Yes, so did I. (<i>Leaning over and speaking confidentially.</i>) An
      inordinate craving for respectability has been the ruin of me. Don't you
      ever give way to it. (<i>Cherry looks puzzled.</i>) You see, Travers&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <h5>
      ADAM CHERRY.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Your first?
    </p>
    <h5>
      MRS. BEN DIXON.
    </h5>
    <p>
      My <i>première</i>. He was a bit wild, and when he died, poor man, and
      left me with a pot of money, I said to myself, "Now, Belinda Travers, <i>nee</i>
      Greggs, you've lived long enough in Bohemia. We'll just go in now for
      respectability; none of your mere Kensington or Hampstead sort, but the
      downright solid stuff." And so I just set to work to look for
      respectability, and (<i>with a motion towards Ben Dixon</i>) I found that!
      (<i>Looks across at him. He is standing in a beautiful attitude, beaming,
      his hands folded together, talking to Nelly.</i>) That's not a respectable
      man. That's potted respectability. They must have boiled down a church to
      make that. I never thought that there was so much respectability in the
      world. <i>I'd</i> never come across so much before, all at one time.
    </p>
    <h5>
      ADAM CHERRY.
    </h5>
    <p>
      And how do you like it?
    </p>
    <h5>
      MRS. BEN DIXON.
    </h5>
    <p>
      I don't like it. There's too much of it for me. I ought to have begun with
      small doses. My system can't stand it. I live in an atmosphere of
      respectability, and it's killing me. I never go anywhere that isn't
      respectable. I never do anything that isn't respectable. Until this
      blessed moment I haven't set eyes on anyone who isn't respectable.
    </p>
    <h5>

    <p>
      I know it&mdash;fifteen years, if it's a day&mdash;but you can't have
      ceased to care for me altogether. Come and help me now. I'm going to the
      good man as fast as ever I can. For old love's sake come and hold me back
      a bit. Come down and spend a week with me. Come down and let me talk to

      to Nelly.</i>) I understand, Nell. Don't worry about me. It will make me
      paint all the better. (<i>Aside to Ted as he goes out.</i>) Try and forget
      all that nonsense I talked to you, Ted. It's better as it is. Poor devils

      I would rather be still more alone, Mr. Cherry, if you don't mind. Forgive

      No, dear, only promised&mdash;by someone who did not know the value of

    <h5>

      Perhaps. But bad bargains have to be kept when made, as well as good ones.

    <h5>

      Yes it can, Nell, and <i>must</i>. It makes it a little awkward, his

      I cannot. I do not wish to. I have pledged my word, and I'll keep it.
      Come, it isn't so very terrible (<i>with a smile</i>). I'm not the first
      girl, dear, who's had to say good bye to an impracticable little romance,
      and take the sober reality offered her by an elderly gentleman. He <i>is</i>
      a gentleman, Ted, and he's very fond of me I know, and I shall try and
      make him a good wife. (<i>Puts her hands on Ted's shoulders</i>.) It's a

      down and see Cherry now, and end the matter at once. (<i>Breaking away

      Nelly, what an obstinate little thing you are. (<i>With a gesture of

      go out into the streets until it's dark because of my clothes. I'm tired
      of feeling hungry. It's such a vulgar feeling. We have no one to help us.
      You talk about aunt. You know that man has all her money, and he's not
      likely to let us have any of it&mdash;even if we cared to take it. As for
      Jack&mdash;poor boy&mdash;what could he give me? What could I bring him
      but the same weary sordid struggle? (<i>She puts her arms about him.</i>)
      Don't be shocked at me, old boy. I used to have plenty of sentiment, as
      you know, but somehow it doesn't thrive on ten shillings a week. (<i>She
      moves away a few steps. Then pausings turns to him, stretching out her

      opening on garden. Adam Cherry and Mr. Ben Dixon are sitting talking.</i>
    </p>
    <h5>
      MR. BEN DIXON.
    </h5>
    <p>
      You see, my dear sir, this is not an ordinary worldly speculation. We are
      promoting this company&mdash;myself and a few Christian friends&mdash;not
      merely to earn an income for our shareholders&mdash;though that we shall
      do, Mr. Cherry, that we shall do&mdash;but also to benefit humanity at
      large. Think, Mr. Cherry, what a grand thing it will be to be helping the
      good cause&mdash;to be doing good among one's fellow-creatures&mdash;and
      at a profit, Mr. Cherry&mdash;at a very handsome profit&mdash;that's the
      beauty of the scheme. Mr. Cherry, as a man not altogether inexperienced in
      these matters, I say that never&mdash;never before has such an opportunity
      been presented to the investing public of combining the earthly comfort of
      a certain 15 per cent, dividend with the ennobling&mdash;I say the
      ennobling&mdash;satisfaction of furthering the cause of Heaven.
    </p>
    <h5>
      ADAM CHERRY.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Well, to be perfectly frank with you, Mr. Ben Dixon, I am thinking more of
      the earthly than of the heavenly part of it. I hope I try to do my bit of
      good in the world, but I never mix the two things up. When I invest my
      money, what I think about is the return.
    </p>
    <h5>
      MR. BEN DIXON.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Quite right, Mr. Cherry, quite right. We&mdash;myself and the other
      directors&mdash;are, perhaps, a little too etherial in these matters. We
      need among us such a man as yourself, Mr. Cherry&mdash;you will join our
      hoard, Mr. Cherry? You will give us the benefit of your experience&mdash;
      of your grasp of business?
    </p>
    <h5>
      ADAM CHERRY.
    </h5>
    <p>
      (<i>Pleased</i>.) Well, if you really think I could be of any help&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <h5>
      MR. BEN DIXON.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Think it! My dear sir, you are the very man we want. I think, Mr. Cherry&mdash;I
      think you suggested put-ting £8,000 into the affair?
    </p>
    <h5>
      ADAM CHERRY.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Yes, Mr. Ben Dixon. It is a big sum for me. In fact&mdash;in fact, it
      represents nearly all my savings. But the scheme seems a very safe one.
    </p>
    <h5>
      MR. BEN DIXON.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Mr. Cherry do you think that I would allow you to put your money in this
      thing if I did not know that it was safe? How can we fail! We have the
      Lord Mayor. (<i>Confidentially.</i>) I am even in hopes of having the
      Archbishop of Canterbury. Besides, look at the scheme itself. We buy up
      and amalgamate all the leading manufactories of temperance drinks
      throughout the kingdom. My dear sir, do you know the amount that is spent
      every year in this country on lemonade and ginger-beer alone?
    </p>
    <h5>
      ADAM CHERRY.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Oh, I am quite with you, Mr. Ben Dixon. The business ought to be a good
      one.
    </p>
    <h5>
      MR. BEN DIXON.
    </h5>
    <p>
      It <i>is</i> a good one. It shall be a better one. Mr. Cherry, in a few
      years' time we shall not be earning our 15 per cent., no, nor our 30 per
      cent., but our 100 per cent., and you shall be with us. Here, Mr. Cherry,
      is an application form. (<i>He has put it all ready</i>.) I will make it a
      personal matter that the full number of shares shall be allotted to you.

      into one basket.
    </p>
    <h5>
      MR. BEN DIXON.

    <p>
      It depends upon the basket I suppose. I should say it would be better to
      put them all into one sound basket than in half-a-dozen risky ones. (<i>Laughs.</i>)

    <h5>

      Of course, before it did not matter. But now, Mr. Ben Dixon&mdash;now that
      I'm going to be married I wish if possible to be able to retire from
      business altogether, and that, of course, with my small capital I could
      not do unless&mdash;

    <h5>
      MR. PEN DIXON.
    </h5>
    <p>
      (<i>Stopping him</i>.) Mr. Cherry, I will be frank with you. You speak of
      the very matter that has been in my mind. If you had come to us two or
      three months ago, and had asked for these shares I should have said "No."
      I should have said to my brother directors: This is a safe and brilliant
      scheme, let us keep it to ourselves. Why should we admit this man among
      us? Let him be content with his two and a half Goschens, his three per
      cent, debentures. But now, Mr. Cherry, I think of Nelly&mdash;my dear
      little Nelly&mdash;and I say, "Come." Come and share with us. That is the
      line for signature, Mr. Cherry.
    </p>

      They <i>may</i> have been. I stood them drinks&mdash;if that be the
      correct expression. Not to excite suspicion, I even sipped a little here
      and there myself. I endeavoured to acquire the spirit of the place.
    </p>
    <h5>
      THEODORE TRAVERS.

      From all accounts, you did so to a pretty considerable extent.

      It was necessary to my purpose. I went from bar to bar accumulating
      material. The case was almost complete. Thinking I had had enough&mdash;done
      enough for one evening, I was about to leave when somebody&mdash;who said
      he was a friend of mine&mdash;suggested that we should go "behind the
      scenes." He introduced me to a not unprepossessing young woman, whom he
      described as the "Female Hercules." I was on the point of putting a few
      questions to her, when all of a sudden a strange feeling of dizziness came
      over me. To save myself from falling, I flung out my arms&mdash;as any man
      might have done&mdash;and caught hold of the thing nearest to me.
      Unfortunately, it was the Hercules lady. Mistaking my action, she took me
      up, and, before I could explain matters, carried me out, and deposited me
      in the main transept.

    <h5>

    <p>
      And then the Aquarium attendants completed the business by chucking you
      out into the street.

    <h5>

      I deny it. I was not chucked. 'They perceived that I was unwell, and led

      Where my excellent friend, the door-keeper at the Hanoverian, found you
      putting pennies into a life boat box and trying to get out cigarettes.
      Ben, that explanation's too thin. I expected something better from you.

      the name?
    </p>
    <h5>

    </h5>
    <p>
      No. Merely refers to you as "a certain guardian of the public morals." (<i>Looking
      at the picture again.</i>) Hardly any need to put the name in this case.
      It would be an insult to the artist.

    <h5>

    <h5>

      Certainly, my dear, certainly. Won't you sit over here, my dear? That

    </p>
    <h5>

    </h5>

      The chair's all right. It's you who seem to be uncomfortable. (<i>Looks

    </p>
    <h5>

    <p>
      (<i>Rather alarmed.</i>) No, my dear, nothing whatever. Don't you rise.
      It's all right. You were speaking about those dear children, Ted and
      Nelly?
    </p>
    <h5>

    </h5>
    <p>
      Difficult to remember what one is talking about with you pirouetting all
      over the place like a pantomime fairy. I wanted to talk to you about what
      we could do for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are going back to-morrow morning, and&mdash;&mdash; (<i>He peers
      under the table for the paper.</i>) I'll tell you what it is, Ben, you are
      doing too much work on that Vigilance Association. It's sapping your
      brain. Do give the world a rest. Let it go wrong for a bit if it wants to.
    </p>
    <h5>

    <h5>
      MRS. BEN DIXON.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Yes, and I expect that's what the others think too. This is a case where
      you can trouble yourself about other folks to some advantage&mdash;to <i>them</i>.
      We must do something for those children, Ben. It was your fault they lost
      their money. We must see that they get some thing back again.
    </p>
    <h5>
      MR. BEN DIXON.
    </h5>
    <p>
      But, you see, my dear, they are both so proud. To offer them help would
      only be to wound them. We should never, Belinda, do anything to wound the
      susceptibilities of others.
    </p>
    <h5>
      MRS. BEN DIXON.
    </h5>
    <p>
      (<i>Growing irritable.</i>) I shall do something that will wound yours,
      Ben, in a minute, if you've got any. There are more ways of offering
      people help than by slapping them in the face with it. If the thing's done
      in the right spirit they won't refuse it. I'll see to that.
    </p>
    <h5>
      MR. BEN DIXON.
    </h5>
    <p>
      But, my dear, why should we interfere at all? Dear Mr. Cherry is only too
      anxious to help them. Why should we deprive that worthy man of the
      exquisite pleasure of assisting them? My dear, we have no right to &mdash;it's
      his first call&mdash;I mean his privilege&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <h5>
      MRS. BEN DIXON.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Ben, you're either a fool or you're pretending to be one. What do you
      think induced that girl to accept him?
    </p>
    <h5>
      MR. BEN DIXON.
    </h5>
    <p>
      The usual thing, I suppose, my dear. Love that comes to&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <h5>
      MRS. BEN DIXON.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Fiddlesticks! Girls of nineteen don't marry men of fifty-five for love.
    </p>
    <h5>
      MR. BEN DIXON.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Forty-three, my dear. He told me so himself.
    </p>
    <h5>
      MRS. BEN DIXON.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Forty-three, <i>and</i> the rest. <i>I'm</i> not a chicken, and he wore
      his own beard when he played Macbeth to my child's head. He's fifty-five
      if he's a day, and she's accepted him because they were both starving&mdash;small
      blame to her for it. What we've got to do is to lift them out of this
      poverty and give them a start, and then there'll be no need for the poor
      girl to sacrifice herself.
    </p>
    <h5>
      MR. BEN DIXON.
    </h5>
    <p>
      But think of Mr. Cherry.
    </p>
    <h5>
      MRS. BEN DIXON.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Oh, Cherry's an old fool, as good and kind a one as ever lived&mdash;that's
      better than some of them are&mdash;but an old fool all the same. Now come,
      Ben, I'm going to do my duty by poor dead Hetty's bairns, and you've got
      to help me. If they were cannibals or converted acrobats with no claim
      upon you whatever, you'd be eager enough to.
    </p>
    <h5>
      MR. BEN DIXON.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Precisely so, my dear. That is just it. You see, a public philanthropist
      has no right to indulge in private charities. He is meant for all alike.
      He embraces mankind. I embrace mankind. You find me two hundred poor
      medical students with their sisters, needing assistance, and I shall be
      delighted to receive subscriptions on their behalf. (<i>Aside</i>.) Oh, he
      must have taken it with him.
    </p>
    <h5>
      MRS. BEN DIXON.
    </h5>
    <p>
      I don't doubt it. In this case, you're going to <i>give</i> something to
      <i>one</i> poor medical student. The other 199 you can find for yourself.
    </p>
    <h5>
      MR. BEN DIXON.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Belinda, I cannot. It grieves me, but I cannot depart from my principles.
      Charity should be like the sun&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <h5>
      MRS. BEN DIXON.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Yours <i>is</i>, Ben. We hear a good deal about it, but don't often see

    </p>
    <h5>
      MR. BEN DIXON.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Then I'm very much afraid, my dear, you will have to do what a great many

    </p>
    <h5>
      MRS. BEN DIXON.

      I mean, my dear, I cannot.

    <h5>
      MR. BEN DIXON.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Belinda, your vulgar expressions pain me. There is no need to be violent.
      Your own little fortune is undoubtedly somewhat involved, but so long as I
      have a crust&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <h5>
      MRS. BEN DIXON.
    </h5>
    <p>
      I don't want your crusts. I want to know what you've done with all my
      money. There was a tidy bit of it, and you've had the entire control of it&mdash;more
      fool me. What have you done with it?
    </p>
    <h5>
      MR. BEN DIXON.

    <h5>

    </h5>

      Oh! drop that. I'm tired of your Heaven. It's enough to set anyone against

      Respectability! Man alive, don't talk about it. The very sound of the word
      makes me ill. It's been my curse from a child. I refused to play hopscotch
      at eight years old because I thought it wasn't respectable, and went
      sliding instead and was nearly drowned. It was I who persuaded poor father
      to give up the fried-fish shop because fried fish wasn't respectable, and
      he went into oysters and ruined himself in a year. I was earning twenty
      pounds a week at the Halls, and what did I do? Threw it up and went on the
      stage as principal boy at five pounds&mdash;all to be respectable. And
      then the stage wasn't respectable enough for me, so I married Travers, and
      <i>he</i> wasn't respectable enough for me. And what has it all ended in?
      What has this insatiable craving for respectability brought me to? Why,
      I'm the wife of a man who has been chucked&mdash;chucked from the
      Aquarium.

      to be present, and sent to the paper for a joke&mdash;seems to me an

      and that his name was Ben Dixon. She said she didn't care what he was or
      what he was called: his real name was Wheedles, he was her lawful married
      husband, and if we would bring her face to face with him she would
      precious soon prove it.

    <h5>

    <p>
      Oh, by-the-bye, she gave me this too (<i>produces photo and shows it</i>).
      The last portrait of Wheedles&mdash;taken four years ago. (<i>Ted takes
      paper, and compares photo with paper.</i>) Should you say 'twas the same

    <h5>

    </h5>
    <p>
      No. I asked her that. Wheedles seems to have always lived a clean-shaven
      life.

      Tolerably sure of it, Mrs. Wheedles. I flatter myself I baited the hook
      pretty artfully. I wrote him that if he could call here about four o'clock
      to-day I could introduce him to a lady who I knew took great interest in
      his schemes, and that I thought some advantage might result from the
      meeting. (<i>Chuckles</i>.) And so I hope it will.

      Well, of course it's a very unpleasant position for her, but, between
      ourselves, I fancy she will be very glad if it turns out that he <i>is</i>
      your husband, and, consequently, not hers. I expect that's why she's so
      anxious to be in the "show," as she calls it. She says she wants to see
      the truth for herself, and fix him down.

      one to you, Adam Cherry.

      Will you come upstairs and see my aunt before she goes, Adam?

    <p>
      Oh, tell her, my dear, she can come down. It's all right now. Come in a
      minute I want to speak to you. (<i>He closes door.</i>)

      Yes, my dear.

      For good?

    <h5>

    </h5>
    <p>
      Let us hope so. He is on his way to the continent. And (<i>giving to her
      letter</i>) he left this letter, my dear, for you and Ted. I think you
      will find the contents very satisfactory.
    </p>
    <h5>
      NELLY MORRIS.
    </h5>
    <p>
      It's the best thing that could happen, undoubtedly. I suppose he's walked
      off with nearly all aunt's money?
    </p>
    <h5>
      ADAM CHERRY.
    </h5>
    <p>
      A good deal of it I'm afraid, dear. And he's not the only old man who's
      had the idea of walking off with other people's property.

    </p>
    <h5>
      ADAM CHERRY.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Yes, my dear (<i>turning towards her</i>). An old gentleman, my dear, (<i>taking
      her hand and stroking it</i>) that was about to walk off with a beautiful
      young lady who, by all the laws of love, was the rightful property of
      somebody else. Only, fortunately, he was stopped in time. (<i>Nelly looks
      at him and is about to speak. Stopping her, kindly.</i>) Don't say
      anything, my dear, it will be less painful for both of us. I was an old
      fool; and you&mdash;you thought of others more than of yourself, my dear.
      (<i>Lightly</i>) The property must be restored to its real owner, and I
      must leave you, my dear, to make all necessary compensation for temporary
      loss. See Jack and tell him you are free.

      Poor soul! I must stop and say a kind word to her. I've been calling her a

    </p>
    <h5>

    <h5>

    <p>
      Well, it all depends upon how you look at it. He's, got himself engaged to

    <h5>

      You mustn't think that at all, Mr. Cherry.
    </p>
    <p>
      I haven't any money, we're going to give it all away. Ted doesn't want me

      (<i>Who has been occupying an unobtrusive position, taking notes.</i>) You
      know I think it extremely uncivil of you; Ted, I had always regarded
      Primrose as my own personal property. I had been "nursing" her, as we say
      in the political world, for years.

    </h5>
    <p>
      My dear Primrose, that's a great mistake people make. A literary man
      doesn't want a literary wife. It would be like living with a critic. A
      clever man wants a wife foolish enough to always admire him. We should
      have got on admirably together. (<i>To Cherry</i>.) You haven't seen my
      pocket-book about anywhere, have you, Cherry?

    <h5>

      suppose?
